# Bamazon
##An Amazon-like storefront with MySQL

##Synopsis

Bamazon is an interactive node app.  MySQL and Node.js are used in conjunction to create an inventory of items that may be selected for purchase by the user.  

To initiate the program, the user types:   node bamazonCustomer.js

This will list the current inventory in a table.  The user will be prompted to enter the item number, then how many units of that item they would like to purchase. The app will verify if the item number is valid, and validate that there is sufficient quantities of stock to purchase and inform the user if either is invalid. If there are sufficient quantities of the item number in question, the total cost for the purchase is given and the user is informed their transaction is complete, and the number of units will be updated in the table.
